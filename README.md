# EXP2 - Numerical Python <br/> *Christian Justin M. Fernando | 2ECE-B | ECE2112*
Hello! This repository contains Python codes I made for my ECE2112 course, particularly for Experiment #2. <br/><br/> For experiment #2 the problems and instructions are:



**1. Normalization Problem:** Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in
data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the
mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation. Mathematically, normalization can be expressed as: ùëç =(ùëã ‚àí ùë•ÃÖ) / ùúé
In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and.std() calls. In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy <br/>

  ```
  #Assign numpy to be np.
  import numpy as np

  #Create a random 5x5 array.
  X = np.random.random((5, 5))

  #Assigning variable to the mean and standard deviation of the variable 'X' using .mean() and .std() calls.
  mean = X.mean()
  std = X.std()

  #Assign the normalization formula to variable 'formula'.
  formula = (X - mean) / std

  #Print the normalization formula.
  print(formula)

  #Saving the normalized array to a designated file.
  np.save('X_normalized.npy', formula)

  #Output to indicate that the array has been saved successfully.
  print("\nYour file has been saved as 'X_normalized.npy' successfully!")
```
**Output example:**
```
[[ 0.43494415 -0.91163436  1.23861816 -0.129228    1.09122219]
 [-0.79737562 -1.10107894 -0.68677011 -1.35623225  0.86536128]

 [ 1.14963972  0.04739948  0.78603041 -1.89616875  0.35921189]
 [-0.89107567  1.12934374 -1.7746977  -0.00355081  0.61041133]]

Your file has been saved as 'X_normalized.npy' successfully! 
```

**2. Divisible by 3 Problem:** Create the following 10 x 10 ndarray, Which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers.
From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy

```
#Assign numpy to be np.
import numpy as np

#First 100 positive integers array.
A = np.arange(1, 101)

#Squaring each integer inside the array created.
sqrdnum = A ** 2

#Reshaping into 10x10 array.
reshapedA = sqrdnum.reshape(10, 10)

#Determining values that are divisible by 3.
divisible_by_3 = reshapedA[reshapedA % 3 == 0]

#Print the results.
print("A 10x10 Array of Squared Numbers:")
print(reshapedA)

print("\nThese are the values that are divisible by 3:")
print(divisible_by_3)

np.save('div_by_3.npy', div_by_3)

#Output to prompt the user that the file has been saved as 'div_by_3.npy' succesfully.
print("\nYour file has been saved as 'div_by_3.npy' successfully!")
```
**Output Example: **
```
A 10x10 Array of Squared Numbers:
[[    1     4     9    16    25    36    49    64    81   100]

 [  441   484   529   576   625   676   729   784   841   900]
 [  961  1024  1089  1156  1225  1296  1369  1444  1521  1600]

 [ 8281  8464  8649  8836  9025  9216  9409  9604  9801 10000]]

These are the values that are divisible by 3:
[   9   36   81  144  225  324  441  576  729  900 1089 1296 1521 1764
